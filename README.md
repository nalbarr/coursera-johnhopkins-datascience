This is main repository to group the my course work as part of Coursera Data Science Specialization by [John Hopkins University, ](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science).

Instructors:
- Roger D. Peng, PhD, Associate Professor, Biostatistics
- Brian Caffo, PhD, Professor, Biostatistics
- Jeff Leek, PhD, Associate Professor, Biostatistics

Course Modules:
- Course 1:  [The Data Scientist's Toolbox](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools)
- Course 2:  [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)
- Course 3:  [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning)
- Course 4:  [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis)

### My Learning Objectives
- Learn from Roger Peng, etc.; Understand John Hopkins perspective on Data Science 
- Understand R community within Healthcare, Biostatistics
- Learn R as a language and understanding tooling and dependencies
- Perform literature search at it applies to Healthcare use case using R for publishing research results.

### Eureka! moment
#### If you plan to only audit class, one thing to focus on
- Course 3: Getting and Cleaning Data (by analyzing the UCI Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Data Set
- During this project, I felt most productive and synthesized multiple concepts and skills; Also, it felt more real world with having to more domain analysis and data wrangling

### Key Takeaways
- R is domain specific language (DSL) that most applied statistics will use from top down;  Bottom up approach would be Python (Numpy, Scipy, etc.)
- R is easy to learn; more procedural and assignment
- Data frames, RShiny, etc. are nice to use
- OO/module paradigm is complex and too many ways of doing the same thing
- For complex data science projects that require pipelines
- RStudio has community (i.e., Microsoft heavily backing)
